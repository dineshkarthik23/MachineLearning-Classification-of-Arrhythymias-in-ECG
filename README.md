# MachineLearning-Classification-of-Arrhythymias-in-ECG
This project presents an automated system for 
detecting and classifying cardias arrhythmias from ECG data. 
The system utilizes machine learning techniques to analyze 
ECG signals, extract relevant features, and classify 
arrhythmias. The pipeline includes data preprocessing, 
feature extraction (QRS duration, R-R intervals, heart rate 
variability), and classification using supervised (Logistic 
Regression, Decision Tree, K-NN, Random Forests, SVM) 
and unsupervised (K-Means) learning algorithms.
